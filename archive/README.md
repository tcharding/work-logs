Work Session Logs    
=================    

**Old work logging system, written in Python.**
  
This tree contains log files created during my daily working hours.  
  
Log entries are created using `log.py`  
  
To view reports clone repository and run `report.py`  
  
Example usage:  
  
`./report.py September.md`    
`./report.py *.md --by-category`    


*.log are the original conversions for use with new Perl scritp `../work-log.pl`
